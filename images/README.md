## Images

This directory should contain images used for obtaining the object crops. In the original project, the images are stored in the `paintings` directory, which contained about 5000 paintings by 100 different artists. 

The images are used to train the objectness methods. The images are not included in this repository due to their size. You can use any set and however many images as you want. Make sure to change the path in the code accordingly.
